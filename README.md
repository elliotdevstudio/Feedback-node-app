Feedback - Mongoose, express, Node, MongoDB, EJS
This application is a reverse engineering project to mimick the functionality of the 'Facebook' comments feature, but serves more as a blog site where users can post writing prompts to a feed seen by all authorized users, who can then select and comment their thoughts on those posts. 

This application implements user auth with express-sessions stored in an external mongo atlas db, and CRUD functionality. 

This was my first time collaborating on a fullstack express server application with a database, and it was definitely a challenge to familiarize myself with all the facets and nuances of using npm dependencies (and implementing a file structure that links everything together) in the time we had available to deliver MVP, but it was a great learning experience that showed me how versatile and open the node.js environment can be. In the very near future this project will be deployed for demonstrational purposes with an update to follow once it goes live. 

Thanks for checking!
